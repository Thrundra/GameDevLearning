Bright light wakes you from your slumber.  The darkness of the night is cast away, but the narrow beam of light that hits your face still shys away from the corners of the room you are in.

The room you are in is a small, dirty, cell, of which you are lying on the floor, upon a dirty clump of moudly hey.  A pain, like a hammer hitting the back of your eyes, wracks your skull with pain when you open your eyes.

What should you do?
1. Get up off the floor.
2. Close your eyes and wait for the pain to subside.
